tcl             General information on Tcl.

Tcl, pronounced "tickle", stands for "Tool Command Language". It is
basically a shell that you extend with your own commands to make an
application. Tcl has been incorporated into icb, or icb has been
incorporated into Tcl, depending on how you look at it.

The net result is that now users have a very flexible command parser.
They can rename or delete commands, define their own commands and
abbreviations, and write Tcl programs to do things.

Tcl is too complicated to cover here. The user is referred to the Tcl
reference document, included in the icb distribution in the "docs"
directory. The rest of the Tcl documentation, which deals with how
to interface Tcl with C programs, is in the official Tcl release,
available via anonymous ftp from ucbvax.berkeley.edu.

See the help topic for info on the fnrc file, which has some sample
uses of Tcl.
