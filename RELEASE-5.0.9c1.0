Release Notes - ICB C Client Revision 5.0.9c1.0 - 25 Jan 1995

This is a significant patch which adds ANSI color support to the ICB 
client.  There are a few minor bugs which were introduced with the 
addition of color capability; most of these, hopefully, will be fixed as 
they are found.  (There are a few which aren't yet fully understood.)

The original color-ICB permitted color to be disabled only by removing 
the .cicbrc file, and had a .cicbrc file format which, although 
technically human-readable, was distinctly not human-legible.  This was 
later replaced by a much more readily readable .cicbrc file format, and a 
switch to disable color was added.  In this release, version 5.0.9c1.0, 
the sense of the color switch has been reversed, so that color OFF is now 
the default.  To enable color, the -color switch (which can be 
abbreviated to -co) must be used.  This allows full backward 
compatibility with the non-color client, and allows all macros that 
worked with the non-color client to also work without modification on the 
color client.  With this change, there is no longer a need to maintain 
separate source for the color and non-color clients.

For easy invocation of color or non-color clients at will, it is 
suggested that the following alias be created:

	alias cicb='icb -co'
