hush            Using hush to silence annoying users.

ICB has a large base of diverse users. It is inevitable that there
are going to be people who do not get along. Rather than censoring users,
I prefer to give people tools that allow them to reduce or negate the
problem.

To deal with annoying users, the first line of defense is the facility
called "hushing". Use of the hush command enables you to block all
communications from a particular person to you. You won't receive any
group messgages, personal messages, beeps, or invitations from them.

Hush acts a toggle, so if you decide that person doesn't bug you anymore,
you can reenable them by hushing them again. If you give the hush command
without a nickname, a list of currently hushed people will be printed.

Hush operates on a nickname; a hushee may get around your hushlist by
changing his or her nickname.  You may prevent this by using the s_hush
(server hush) command; this command lets you define a set of users
to ignore based on their sites.  

Hush is the preferred way of dealing with problem users. Other means
include using the moderated group facility, and when all else fails,
complaining to the administration. If a user is persistent enough that
hush won't take care of them, see the rules section for what to do.
