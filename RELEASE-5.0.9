Release Notes - ICB C Client Revision 5.0.9 - 13 Jul 1994

This is a small but important patch, fixing a major bug that has been causing
coredumps since 5.0.5.

Bugs Fixed:

	ICB-BUG-5.0.5-2: ICB dumps core a variable amount of time after any
		erroneous /display command.  (Original abstract limiting
		behavior to Solaris 2.x was incorrect.)

	Description:
		Any time the "usage" message from the c_replay command
		is displayed, part of the TCL command list is overwritten.
		As soon as TCL attempts to traverse the command list past that
		point, the client dumps core.  (Typing a nonexistent command
		is will force the traversal.)


Features Added: none


Known Bugs Remaining:

	ICB-BUG-5.0.5-7: Under Irix, the pagesize variable is intermittently
		reset to 0; eventually, paging fails to operate even with
		nonzero value of pagesize.

	ICB-BUG-5.0.5-8: Under Ultrix, output to the log file is only rarely
		flushed.
