Recent user-visible changes to Tcl:

1. No more [command1] [command2] construct for grouping multiple
commands on a single command line.

2. Semi-colon now available for grouping commands on a line.

3. For a command to span multiple lines, must now use backslash-return
at the end of each line but the last.

4. "Var" command has been changed to "set".

5. Double-quotes now available as an argument grouping character.

6. "Return" may be used at top-level.

7. More backslash sequences available now.  In particular, backslash-newline
may be used to join lines in command files.

8. New or modified built-in commands:  case, return, for, glob, info,
print, return, set, source, string, uplevel.

9. After an error, the variable "errorInfo" is filled with a stack
trace showing what was being executed when the error occurred.

10. Command abbreviations are accepted when parsing commands, but
are not recommended except for purely-interactive commands.

11. $, set, and expr all complain now if a non-existent variable is
referenced.

12. History facilities exist now.  See Tcl.man and Tcl_RecordAndEval.man.

13. Changed to distinguish between empty variables and those that don't
exist at all.  Interfaces to Tcl_GetVar and Tcl_ParseVar have changed
(NULL return value is now possible).  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

14. Changed meaning of "level" argument to "uplevel" command (1 now means
"go up one level", not "go to level 1"; "#1" means "go to level 1").
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

15. 3/19/90 Added "info exists" option to see if variable exists.

16. 3/19/90 Added "noAbbrev" variable to prohibit command abbreviations.

17. 3/19/90 Added extra errorInfo option to "error" command.

18. 3/21/90 Double-quotes now only affect space:  command, variable,
and backslash substitutions still occur inside double-quotes.
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

19. 3/21/90 Added support for \r.

20. 3/21/90 List, concat, eval, and glob commands all expect at least
one argument now.  *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

21. 3/22/90 Added "?:" operators to expressions.

22. 3/25/90 Fixed bug in Tcl_Result that caused memory to get trashed.

------------------- Released version 3.1 ---------------------

23. 3/29/90 Fixed bug that caused "file a.b/c ext" to return ".b/c".

24. 3/29/90 Semi-colon is not treated specially when enclosed in
double-quotes.

------------------- Released version 3.2 ---------------------

25. 4/16/90 Rewrote "exec" not to use select or signals anymore.
Should be more Sys-V compatible, and no slower in the normal case.

26. 4/18/90 Rewrote "glob" to eliminate GNU code (there's no GNU code
left in Tcl, now), and added Tcl_TildeSubst procedure.  Added automatic
tilde-substitution in many commands, including "glob".

------------------- Released version 3.3 ---------------------
