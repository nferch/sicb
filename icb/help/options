                relative to HOME. If ICBRC is specified and the corresponding
                file is not found, and error message will be printed.

    ICBNAME     Default nickname to use, instead of your login id.

    SHELL       Shell to use for shellouts. If unspecified then /bin/sh
                is assumed.
