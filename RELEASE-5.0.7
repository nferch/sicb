Release Notes - ICB C Client Revision 5.0.7


These release notes cover the changes between 5.0.5 and 5.0.7.  Version 5.0.6
was a limited release that never made it completely public.


Bugs Fixed:

	ICB-BUG-5.0.5-1: sometimes initial characters are echoed twice

	ICB-BUG-5.0.5-3: fall-through server commands are ignored or cause
		         coredump when invoked with no arguments

	ICB-BUG-5.0.5-4: long (>255 characters) /write messages don't get sent
			  at all

	ICB-BUG-5.0.5-5: sample.icbrc contains invalid comment syntax

	ICB-BUG-5.0.5-6: outbound personal messages appear twice in log file

	ICB-BUG-5.0.5-9: fails to compile on Linux

	ICB-BUG-5.0.5-10: compiles but generates warning messages under gcc
		on SunOS 4.x and Linux


Features Added:
		
	ICB-FEATURE-5.0.5-1: <tab> key should provide completion functions

	    Description:

		When pressed at the end the second word on the command line,
		the <tab> key will search your tab history for a nickname 
		beginning with the characters of that word typed thus far;
		it will complete the nickname up to the limit of the uniqueness
		of the prefix.  In all other contexts, the behavior of the tab
		key is unchanged.


	ICB-FEATURE-5.0.5-2: setup should be more intelligent about directory
		locations.

	    Description:
		setup will change the default "man" and "lib" directories to
		match the user-supplied "bin" directory.


	ICB-FEATURE-5.0.5-3: use of server registration features should not
		require entering or logging of visible passwords

	    Description:

		/bump and /cp will now prompt you for your password (in the
		case of /cp, your old and new passswords) if they
		are not specified on the command line.  These passwords
		are not echoed to the screen nor logged in the replay buffer 
		or log file.

		A new command, /register, has been added.  This will prompt for
		your password as above and register your nickname (e.g. /m
		server p password).

		A new variable, autoreg, has been added.  If this variable is 
		set to true (it defaults to false), then the receipt of 
		a "Send password to register nick" message from the server will
		cause the client to automatically invoke the /register command
		and register your nick.



Known Bugs Remaining:

	ICB-BUG-5.0.5-2: Under Solaris 2.x, /display -n (error) followed by
		/display -nick sometimes causes coredump (not reproducible by
		author)

	ICB-BUG-5.0.5-7: Under Irix, the pagesize variable is intermittently
		reset to 0; eventually, paging fails to operate even with
		nonzero value of pagesize.

	ICB-BUG-5.0.5-8: Under Ultrix, output to the log file is only rarely
		flushed.
