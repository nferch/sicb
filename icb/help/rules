rules                   Rules for ICB use.

In general, ICB is a "free speech" system. Users are encouraged to
air their viewpoints and to comment freely on the viewpoints of others.

Nonetheless, there are rules designed to "keep the peace" and in
general protect people from abuse.

ICB usage may be reduced, suspended, or revoked for:

        Using lewd or offensive words in nicknames, visible group
        names, or topics.

        Harassing another user. Harassment is defined as behavior
        towards another with the intent purpose of annoying them.

        Sending files or "pictures" through ICB to users that
        don't want to see them.

        Falsifying your identity to the server. Why is this bad?
        Because it is my only way of contacting people so I can
        resolve various problems.

        Any behavior whose purpose is to reduce the functionality of
        ICB, violate the security thereof, or see or allow others
        to see any ICB messages that they would not normally be
        permitted to see. Please don't mess it up for others.

What is "lewd" or "offensive" is up to the ICB server administrator. If
you have doubts, don't use it. Harassment is also largely a matter of
opinion.

Violations are usually straighted out via friendly email. If that fails
to work, a lot of things can happen. In some cases in the past, remote
administrations have been contacted, and even whole sites have been
locked out. 

If you find someone violating the rules, please contact the ICB
server administrator. The address is available with the "version" command.
