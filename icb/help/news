TCL has been incorporated into client, making the command set
extendable and programmable. 

Hush has been implemented. It only currently works by nickname, but
there are plans to extend it in various ways.

A review buffer is now implemented and may be accessed with the "display"
command and the "bufferlines" variable.

Paging is now implemented, usable with the "paging" variable.

The online help system has been totally redone. It has help encoded
into the client sorted by subject. This makes icb independent of outside
files and easier to correctly install.

Murgil now accepts and properly uses numeric addresses. This speeds things
up by bypassing the nameserver. It also makes icb more portable.

The shell command "/!" works better, faithfully looks at the "SHELL"
environment variable, and no longer requires a space between the
exclamation mark and the command.

A new status command shows you the information for the current group, and
what groups you have been invited to.

Session logging and "alert" have been temporarily removed. That
facility will undergo an upgrade next release. It is hoped that output
can be hooked into a Tcl display routine, making message displays user
customizable.

The groupname output has been changed yet again in the never ending
search for aesthetically pleasing output.

The who command has been extended to allow a groupname to be specified
as an argument, giving the list of users for just that group.

ICB variables are now set with the "fset" command, which also can be used
to display the value of those variables.

The routine to determine your login name should now work under programs
like "script" and "screen".

ICB reads the editing characters from the tty struct. This means that users
with modified characters will be able to use those.

Internally, some of the code has been cleaned up and de-linted.
