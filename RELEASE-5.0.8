Release Notes - ICB C Client Revision 5.0.8 - 11 Apr 1994

5.0.8 is a bugfix release.  Three problems that caused coredumps with varying
frequency on different systems have been corrected.  There is one small new
feature: the 'version' command has been modified to show the client version as
well as that of the server; you may also choose to view only one or the other.

There are two additional features documented below; these were present in 
5.0.7 but omitted from the 5.0.7 release notes.

Bugs Fixed:

	ICB-BUG-5.0.7-1: /write nick<RETURN> causes core dump

	ICB-BUG-5.0.7-2: parts of split messages end in garbage

	ICB-BUG-5.0.7-3: frequent coredumps under AIX 3.2.5 and Irix

	ICB-BUG-5.0.7-4: s_open has incorrect usage message


Features added:

[The first two features were actually present in 5.0.7, but were not 
 mentioned in the 5.0.7 release notes]

	ICB-FEATURE-5.0.5-4: <tab> key behavior should be extended to commands
		other than /m

	    Description:

		When pressed at the beginning of a blank line, the behavior of
		the tab key is unchanged - <cmdchar>m <nickname><space> is
		inserted, where <nickname> is the nickname at the top of your
		tab history.
		
		When pressed anywhere else on a line that begins with the
		command character, the second word of the line is changed
		to the nickname at the top of your tab history; the rest of
		the line, including the command, is unchanged; in this 	
		way you my use the tab history on commands other than /m.


	ICB-FEATURE-5.0.5-5: idle times should not lose resolution after one
		hour

	Description
		Times in the "idle" column of the /who output are now displayed
		to the minute, even when the idle time is over an hour.  The
		format is "HHhMMm"; the 'HHh' is omitted for idle times under
		an hour.


	ICB-FEATURE-5.0.7-1: the /version command should display the client
		version

	Description
		The /version command now displays the current client version
		as well as the server version.  Optionally, the output may
		be restricted to just the client or server versions by 
		specifying -c or -s, respectively.
